Steps to create a RAG Pipelines
================================
Phase 1: Indexing
    1.documents -> knowledge base
    2.chunks -> splitting documents
        split the documents using the chunk size and chunk_overlap
        creating the documents object
        actual chunks created using the split_documents
    3. embeddings -> chunks to embeddings (meaning full) -> openai embedding function 
    4. store in db -> chroma 

Phase 2: Querying 
    1. user question
    2. convert to embeddings
    3. search db
    4. retrieval from the docs
    5. llms to generate the answer
    6.Answer which in the structured manner

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It was created by Harrison Chase in October 2022.

## Core Components

1. **Models**: LangChain supports various LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models.

2. **Prompts**: Templates for structuring inputs to language models.

3. **Chains**: Sequences of calls to models and other components.

4. **Agents**: Systems that use LLMs to determine which actions to take.

5. **Memory**: Components for persisting state between chain/agent calls.

## LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications. Key features:
- State management
- Cycles and loops
- Human-in-the-loop
- Persistence

## Pricing

LangChain itself is open source and free. LangSmith (the observability platform) has a free tier and paid plans starting at $39/month.

## Getting Started

Install with: pip install langchain langchain-openai
Create your first chain in under 10 lines of code.
